        paragraph1: "The retail industry has a long legacy in India. In olden times, markets and fairs used to get set up over weekends and holidays. These were the primary source of entertainment for villagers, but slowly they became the hub for transactions of goods where people used to exchange and buy things they needed. As the country developed, a more common form of retail business came into existence. Most of the retail business started happening through convenience stores, also known as mom and pop stores, or neighborhood stores. In India, these small shops are commonly known as 'Kirana’ stores. These stores still comprise a large part of the retail industry, and in every small town one can find hundreds of such stores. In India, Government backed retail stores are also popular. Co-operative stores, Public distribution system, and Khadi stores provide quality products to consumers at highly competitive prices. The retail industry evolved a lot in the last decade with the rise of EBOs (Exclusive brand outlets), supermarkets, shopping malls, and specialty stores. Ecommerce is disrupting and making a big impact in India’s retail landscape. Currently it’s a battle between homegrown FlipKart (now owned by Walmart) and the global leader Amazon. However, with changes in government policies we expect to see other domestic players such as Reliance start to make an impact in the online retail commerce.",
        paragraph2: "The retail market is growing at quite a fast pace in India. With a population of over 1 billion people, India is a highly attractive market for domestic and global retail players. The total retail market in India is estimated to be around $780 billion, which accounts for 10% of the country's GDP. Out of this, 90% is unorganized retail business and around 10% is organized. Kirana stores form the major chunk of unorganized retail market. These shops dominate the Indian retail market, as most Indian consumers still prefer to go to the nearby neighborhood shops to buy daily groceries and consumable items. However, with the growth of eCommerce, fast free deliveries and organized retailers, this is starting to change rapidly. This is further confirmed by the projected growth rates. While Unorganized Retail market is expected to grow at just about 11%, the organized retail market is far ahead with expected growth rate of 19%.",
        paragraph3: " Ecommerce, personalized recommendations and data analytics are helping retailers offer superior products and services to their customers. Deep analysis of online and in-store purchase and browsing history is helping retail players get a better understanding of their customers. This data helps with running targeted promotions based on individual customer’s tastes, preferences and purchasing patterns. Decision trees and learning algorithms trained on neural networks are used to uncover patterns and trends that otherwise would have never surfaced. Products are being priced “correctly” based on live data streams from hundreds of signals. Data related to consumer demand and the competitor's prices is collected and provided as training data to algorithms that then calculate and determine the most competitive price. Retailers are also using technology to set real-time pricing based on demand, time, events and several other variables. For retailers, the key to success lies in creating a unique shopping experience for customers while they are physically present in the store. Data analytics and AI helps stores with identifying optimal product placements. For instance, certain products are placed near the entrance, checkout lines or on specific shelves to help realize higher conversion rates.",
        paragraph4:
            " It is clear to retailers that will have to adopt latest technologies to stay competitive. Sensors and cameras are now being used to provide hassle free shopping experience to consumers. Amazon has launched a chain of convenience stores called Amazon Go in select cities where feedback from cameras and sensors is integrated with technologies like Computer vision and Deep learning. This combination of cutting edge hardware and algorithms allows users to simply pick an item and leave the store – no need to pay at the counter, no facial recognition required, no product scan required. This technology is not only automating the purchase process, but it is also providing very important data to Amazon that forms the basis of further intelligent solutions. For instance, the cameras installed in the Amazon Go stores not only capture what the users are picking, but they also store information about products which were picked up by the user, but were placed back on the shelf. This data is then used by machine learning algorithms to recommend changes that would lead to better conversions. Just how far the technology has advanced can be seen in the virtual fitting rooms being used by Tmall, a Business to Consumer (B2C) online retail company operated by Alibaba in China. Tmall recently launched virtual reality dressing rooms, also known as “magic mirrors” in select cities. These kiosks have augmented reality dashboards where shoppers can try clothes or cosmetics on their virtual avatars before making the purchase. The cameras installed in the kiosk take photos and prepare the full-scale avatar while the user browses through the various clothing options. If they like the dress, the Augmented reality system places the selected dress on the Avatar so that the shopper can see in real-time how the dress would look on them. If they decide to buy, they simply open the Tmall mobile app, scan the QR code for the selected dress, make the payment, and complete the purchase.",
        paragraph5:
            " Big Retail chains are now using robots in different ways to enhance the in-store experience. Robots can recognize a customer and greet them when they enter the retail store. They can also converse with them using speech recognition software, or touch screens. Based on the conversation with the customer, they provide recommendations, or even guide the customer to the correct aisle in the store where they can find the product. Robots can also take a picture of the customer and store the purchase information and other details, so that the next time the same customer comes to shop, the robot recognizes them and offers loyalty rewards or other targeted promotional offers. These are only few examples of the impact of technology on the retail space, but these go to show that the level of innovation possible today is only bound by your imagination.",
        paragraph6: "Is more and more companies are entering the lucrative retail market, competition is only getting tougher. A big chunk of retail business still happens offline - through brick and mortar stores. At the same time, people are spending several hours a day on smartphones and computers. 'Online to Offline (O2O)' offers the potential to leverage mobile technology to drive offline sales and create new business opportunities. The O2O model connects consumers who are online with physical stores, making way for a seamless retail experience. This integrated O2O marketing strategy has resulted in generating new customers as well as increased sales for both online and offline channels. Let's take an example of restaurants. O2O model now enables consumers to browse food menus of their favorite restaurants on their smartphones. They can pick their favorite dish and place the order on the way to the restaurant. When they arrive at the restaurant, their dish is ready and they simply have to pick and move.",
        paragraph7: "Retail giants who have been able to successfully integrate their online and offline businesses are taking away market share from competitors. For instance, the recent tech investments and renewed focus by Walmart are already reaping big results and it is starting to give Amazon’s retail business a run for its money. The line between offline and online retail will continue to blur.",
        paragraph8: "Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, Robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) are pushing retail and commerce into the next phase of the connected experience. The result would be superior customer service, easier and safer shopping experience, lower costs, better inventory and logistics management, and a lot more exciting innovation in retail.",
        paragraph9: "In the year 1939, one of the biggest International Expos of its time was held in New York city. The theme of that fair was “The world of tomorrow”. It was an opportunity for different countries to display their technological achievements and show the world, what the future might look like. In that expo, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, an American company, gave a public demo of the first ever AI powered robot named Elektro. This robot was around 270 pounds and had 48 electric relays in its metal body. It could identify red and green colors, follow voice command, and speak around 700 words. Of course, Elektro was not nearly as sophisticated as the current advanced humanoid robot 'Sophia'. Still, Elektro was a radical AI product for its time that demonstrated the capability and vision of the human race to master machines. Andrew Ng, a very respected AI leader of our generation has called Artificial Intelligence the new age electricity. According to him, similar to how electricity transformed every major industry 100 years ago, Artificial Intelligence is going to do the same – transform every major industry today, but at a much faster pace. Several business and world leaders have called data the new oil in this age of AI. Organizations with the deepest and most comprehensive data sets in different fields will have a huge competitive advantage in building better and smarter self-learning and trained algorithms.",
        paragraph10: "To understand the current state of AI, it is important to go back in the past and study how AI has evolved over the years. The concept of modern Artificial intelligence has been around for decades. Mathematicians and Scientists have held a profound belief that human thinking and intelligence can be improved with the use of computation power. The field of modern computing started with Charles Babbage's mechanical analytic engine in the 1840s. In 1850s, George Boole, an English Mathematician and Logician developed Boolean logic, which defined the output as either True or False. This abstraction of logic by Boole was the first step in giving computers the ability to reason. Later in the year 1936, Alan Turing proposed Turing theory; he broke down the logic into Math, translating it to the machines, so that computers could solve the problems by manipulating strings of ones and zeroes. Turing, while creating the idea of Turing machines, also created the basis of modern computing. In 1948, Claude Shannon published a landmark theory called “Mathematical theory of communication”, which suggested that all information in the entire universe could be represented in binary. This had profound implications for AI suggesting that we could potentially break down human logic and replicate the functioning of the human brain with computing technology. This fact was demonstrated in 1955 by the first ever AI program, called “Logic Theorist”. AI development accelerated during the 1950s and 1960s, and it was during that time only when the term “Artificial Intelligence” was coined by John McCarthy, who is often considered as one of the founding members of the modern AI. Over the decades, scientists kept researching on how to abstract human logic and behavior, making new advancements in the field of AI. As computers became more capable every year, and neural networks and other AI advances started to come through, the research process accelerated, thus giving birth to the modern computer based AI.",
        paragraph11: "Algorithms teach machines to think like humans. Thus just like human brain takes time to learn things, the algorithms are designed so that as more and more simulations are done, the results get better. Once trained, deep learning helps extract useful patterns from data. Machine learning is suddenly seeing a huge surge of interest among researchers, developers and businesses. The key factors behind the recent advancements in the field of machine learning are the availability of big data (from the social web, IoT and mobile), cheaper and more powerful storage and compute power in the cloud, advances in tools, and the investments flowing into AI. Machine learning uses algorithms to analyze data and derive meaningful predictions and conclusions. Data is the most important ingredient in the machine learning process.",
        heading: "Algorithm learning takes the following different forms:",
        bulletPoints: [
            "Supervised Learning",
            "Augmented Supervised Learning",
            "Semi-Supervised Learning",
            "Reinforcement Learning",
            "Unsupervised Learning",
        ],
        paragraph12: "Typically humans learn quickly from few examples and life experiences. In contrast, most machines today still need tons of data and examples to become good at predictions and learning. Errors in predictions are passed back to the neural networks for further training to help increase accuracy. Tools and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, CNTK, Caffe, Keras, Theano and others are helping make it easier to develop ML and Deep Learning models. New compute hardware such as TPU by Google contains custom ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) that is specialized for machine learning. The different Machine-learning schools of thought are inductive reasoning, connectionism, evolutionary computation, bayes theorem and analogical modeling. All these machine-learning tribes are working hard to make progress.",
        paragraph13: "Developments in AI have led to many new startups that are leveraging the power of technology to bring innovative products and solutions to the market. AI and robotics are powering a range of efficiency improvements in the human life – from drones delivering emergency medical kits in remote areas, to helping transform farming to increase crop yield. There has been exciting progress in face and speech recognition, image classification, text-to-speech generation, machine translation, transcription and recommendations. Not everyone is excited about AI since as routine jobs and tasks get automated, there will be a lot of pain in the short term. People will have to get re-skilled which is not easy and takes time. Our educational systems will need to overhaul to keep up with these advancements to provide relevant skill development and training. In the long term, AI will help the world economy grow and create new jobs. There are several jobs that didn’t exist two decades ago. And the same will happen in the next two decades. So should we worry about the increasing impact of AI? Not at the moment. The road to the development of artificial general intelligence is long and complicated. We should embrace the technology and think of new ways of how AI powered apps and machines can bring positive changes to our world.",
        paragraph14: "Real Estate is not only one of the biggest, but also one of the most in demand asset classes around the world. Often considered as one of the best inflation proof assets to hold after gold, owning a property is nothing short of a dream come true for many people. No doubt that real estate sector has had its own share of ups and downs, but it’s important to realize that it is absolutely normal to have market cycles. Ignoring the cyclic recessions, the long-term view is very positive for the real estate sector based on various industry expert views. Explosion in population, continuous growth in economies such as India and China, and increasing wages are few factors that are fueling the need for new home ownership and development of urban cities. Let's have a look at the real estate data coming out of the United States. As per latest reports, in 2017 alone, the total value of homes in US stood at around $32 trillion. Every year, around 5 million houses are sold across the country; 1.1 trillion assets change hands, and around 100 billion dollars is generated in fees. These are staggering figures that force us to think - which factors are actually responsible to facilitate so many transactions in one asset class alone? Well, the reasons may be many, but there is one particular factor which is having a very deep impact on the growth of the Real Estate sector, and that is - Digitization and Big data. Let's dive deep into the modern world of real estate and see how new age startups are utilizing data and technology to accelerate the real estate growth.",
        paragraph15: "Property related deal is one of the single biggest transactions that most people make in their lives. People go to many lengths to make sure they are getting the right deal. It may sound easy, but it is not. Generally, a house search would involve months of preparation. After deciding on the basic design and size of the house, the prospective buyer starts checking numerous other facts, which would eventually help them make a decision on the final deal. Frequent visits to the site, neighborhood check, review of nearby schools, grocery shops, crime rate in the locality, availability of easy public transport, hospitals near by – these are just some of the criteria a would-be buyer scans before making a decision. This is a lot of work. Few years back, the buyers themselves did all of this. Even after so much work, there was always a chance that the deal would not materialize. Now, thanks to digitization and modern recommendation and search technology, the way properties are being sold and bought has completely changed. Buyers can now access all these details with a simple search on their mobile phones. Several real estate marketplaces have come up which are using the power of data science to enable owners and buyers to make transactions hassle free. These companies are collecting real estate data and creating complex algorithms to help make buying decisions. One great example of real estate data science is price estimation. Correct Price estimation of a property is one of the biggest challenges in the real estate sector. Thanks to big data, this problem has been solved to a great extent. Years and years of data related to the sale and purchase of houses in a locality is fed to complex models, which then provide a prediction on the property value. The best thing is, this data is being updated on daily basis thus providing the most accurate price estimates of the property in real-time.",
        paragraph16: "Another great use of data science in real estate is planning and designing an urban city. The improvement in wages, lifestyle and purchasing power has resulted in the development of ultra modern urban cities. A more common term used in this context is “smart city”. Not only new cities, but also already established mega cities are slowly being turned into smart cities. The concept for the 'smart' city is simple – use of digitization, computerization and latest technology to connect the city together. Huge data would be generated from this digitization effort, which would then be collected and analyzed to help improve operations of the city. The result would be better living conditions and enhanced productivity of the city over a long period of time. Let's see the practical use of digitization and big data in the newly developed Songdo International Business District from South Korea. The city has a population of around 100,000 and is connected to the nearest Incheon International airport by a 12-kilometer long bridge. The entire city is built on the underground network of optical fibers, which is going to support high-speed data transfer for next several years. Sensors are placed everywhere in the city to provide real time information about pollution and security. For example, if there is a fire, the nearby sensors would alert the Fire fighting teams instantly thus minimizing the potential damage. The bridge to Songdo city has several CCTV cameras, which capture details of vehicles entering or exiting the city. This data is then transmitted to command centers and is used for automatic payments at toll bridges, or diverting the traffic to alternate routes in rush hours. The entire city is equipped with thousands of cameras that can recognize faces. This data is stored at data centers and is analyzed in real time to identify any potential threat in the city. Houses are also equipped with smart features. Smart electronics control the energy consumption in every house by turning off unnecessary electric gadgets. There are cameras installed at playgrounds that provide real time images direct to homes thus ensuring security and safety of kids.",
        paragraph17: "Big data along with the combination of high tech hardware and machine learning is making sure that the real estate market continues to grow at a fast. People can now buy and sell properties in a much more streamlined manner. Real estate agents are leveraging big data to provide much better services to consumers thus improving the overall satisfaction levels. Renting a house has become much easier. Smart cities are enhancing the living conditions of people thus increasing the overall productivity. High tech sensors and data are resulting in improved safety and security measures for citizens. We expect the pace of innovation to continue in this sector given the huge market opportunity.",
        paragraph18: "Big data and data analytics are transforming the way the Food industry works. The way we grow, produce, process, distribute, and consume food is undergoing a digital revolution. Big data allows companies to unearth complex data patterns into easy to understand models which have a meaningful and result oriented impact on their business. For instance, it has the potential to uncover new correlations between diet and health, linking specific foods to health risks and diseases. The best thing about data analytics is that it can be done anywhere in the world. Even a small lab in Asia can study huge datasets and do predictive analysis of weather conditions and crop yield in a remote village in Africa. Isn't it fascinating? There are numerous such successful case studies where data is revolutionizing the food industry, and the best part is that this is just the start of the technology innovation.",
        paragraph19: "Out of all the steps in the food cycle, farming is the most important, but has benefited the least from digitization and big data till now. In most parts of the world, and specially developing countries, farming is still done by century old methods and techniques. This is not helping in increasing the land productivity. As per several forecasts, the world population will grow to around 9 billion by 2050. Such a large population will require about 50% more food than the current production levels. So what can be done to meet these targets? Well, apart from all the modern day farming machinery and latest hardware, big data is one field, which can actually help the agriculture industry to dramatically increase the crop yield. A lot of data is being generated in the farming industry: data from sensors, irrigation data, historical data of the soil nutrients, weather condition, the seed yield, crop maturity time, pesticides used etc. When meticulously studied and analyzed, these datasets can provide unimaginable insight to farmers, which would help them make right decisions. The end result would be increased productivity, reduced costs, minimized losses, and much more. Historical weather data can alert farmers about potential disasters and they can plan the harvesting accordingly; soil and yield data can help farmers optimize use of pesticides. There are many proven cases where water usage has been minimized just by analyzing various data points coming from the field. As one can imagine, the possibilities of improvements and optimization of farming methods are endless with the use of big data, analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and continuous learning.",
        paragraph20: "Let's have a look at how restaurants are utilizing big data and data analytics to optimize their processes. Some people may feel that only recently restaurants have started utilizing the big data benefits, but that is not true. Pizza chains like Domino's and Papa Johns have been creating databases of their customers for a very long time. They know the location, contact details, and preferences of millions of people who have used their services. So what changed in recent years? Well, with the advances in mobile, cloud and computational power, data scientists and machine learning experts can create extremely complex algorithms and models based on big data which can produce unprecedented results. More and more restaurants are taking help of data analytics to optimize costs, reduce food wastage, learn consumer behavior, improve recipes, and so on. Customer analytics can help with targeted offers. So for instance once you know a family visits your outlet regularly, you can give them targeted discount offers when they book a table, or push a free parking coupon to their mobile as soon as they approach the restaurant. Analyzing sales and demand data also helps with optimizing menu prices to maximize sales volumes and profits.",
        paragraph21: "Big data and analytics are playing a role in the entire food industry value chain – from processing, distribution to ordering. Deeper understanding of data and the intelligence gained from the analytics is helping optimize processes and create superior user experiences. Some manufacturers are taking this opportunity to create increased transparency with customers. Few brands have already started using smart labels on their products. Consumers can scan these smart labels and get details such as nutrients value, presence of any harmful chemicals, the origin of the product, the raw materials used, and much more.",
        paragraph22: "Scientists and various startups are working hard to develop complex algorithms to get the best possible results from data analytics. For example, researchers are analyzing historical data of seeds and trying to create a super seed, which can yield crops in poor weather conditions. If successful, imagine the possible results - explosive food production and reduction in world hunger. Big data adoption is growing at a fast pace and it is time for the food industry to embrace it. The next few years are very exciting as companies will innovate and leverage the power of data and analytics. The result of all these efforts would be superior food quality, better dining out experience, safer and more nutritious food and increased income for farmers.  ",

        paragraph23: "Customer data is the foundation of any loyalty program; yet retail brands have historically faced unique challenges in the loyalty space due to their varied distribution networks and lack of access to point-of-sale data. The techniques for managing loyalty programs from the past are mostly ineffective today due to disruption caused by growth of ecommerce and intense retail competition. Retail brands need to reinvent their loyalty programs to attract, retain and grow customers. The changing landscape of retail along with new channels of shopping (ecommerce, marketplaces, etc.) is making most brands rethink their loyalty programs, as they are unable to tie the point-of-sale purchase data to consumers.",
        paragraph24: "We all know that data is king; and it is the key towards precision marketing or chalking out any successful loyalty or rewards program. We are inundated with data from sales channels, digital platforms, CRM systems, rewards programs, loyalty programs etc.; and this data has never been more valuable. The good thing is that there are many more possibilities to collect and analyze data today; however, online retailers or ecommerce companies have maximum leverage over this. Online shoppers sign up on websites and create a trail of demographic data such as email addresses, age, gender, household size, purchase history, website visits and products viewed even when they don’t end up making a purchase. Every bit of this information when mined, tracked and analyzed results in more targeted and personalized recommendations, loyalty programs, offers, and discounts.",
        paragraph25: "And this is where retail brands are failing as without a direct connection to the point of sale they are unable to collect the required data to bridge the gap in order to build comprehensive loyalty programs or marketing campaigns. So how can they collect this flood of data to create valuable, personalized experiences for customers (just like how ecommerce companies are doing it) and meet their business objectives? Well the answer lies in the simple receipt – the receipt can said to be the holy grail of precision marketing for brands without a direct connection to the point of sale. In fact recent advances in technology such as image scanning and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can help in collecting the data from receipts before they end up in garbage to leverage engagement and loyalty. Receipt data is a like a gold mine containing valuable information for brands and marketers. And to collect that data, all that brands have to do is to encourage their customers through campaigns to take their phones, snap a picture of the receipt and upload it. Yes, it’s that simple. Enabling customers to scan and submit their purchase receipts allows them to truly maximize their loyalty programs and extend offers. Once these receipts are validated, brands and marketers can get access to a wealth of data on consumers shopping preferences. Validating and processing receipts can help in collecting information such as store location, products purchased, date and time of purchase etc. and this information can be extremely valuable in creating effective loyalty programs. In addition to learning more about the consumers shopping preferences, receipt data is a great way to re-target customers and cross-sell across multiple brands. Unlike ecommerce companies or brands with existing loyalty members, which usually have customer’s name along with more personal information such as date of birth etc., receipt validation makes it possible for retailers and brands that lack in-store visibility to collect data on its customers – in terms of what, where and when of their buying patterns. Receipts also help in collecting SKU (stock keeping unit) data, which can further be used to analyze inventory specific data such as which product was actually purchased, where it was purchased, at what prices and with what discounts, and in combination with which other products.",
        paragraph26: "Receipt data holds much promise today for loyalty programs – effective receipt data collection can provide insights to companies to create better and personalized programs. Efficient and accurate receipt data collection will be the key in extracting more value out of rewards and loyalty programs. A combination of scanning, point-of-sale and mobile technologies along with product catalog, inventory and receipt data will put valuable information into the hands of marketers and brands to come up with best retention strategies. Data driven loyalty programs from the offline world will be a key differentiator in the future.",
        paragraph27: "Receipt processing allows brands to run purchase-based promotions without codes on-pack or any point of sale integration. Consumers submit receipts using multiple channels such as SMS, email, mail, mobile web, desktop and in-app options. Brands need to partner with best-of-breed receipt processing technology partners if they don’t have the in-house capability to manage the operations.",
        heading1: "Receipt Processing Overview",
        paragraphA: "Collecting, verifying and processing receipt data is a time consuming and complex process that needs to be thought through and implemented properly. Below are some of the key steps involved in receipt processing and the challenges:",

        ],
        paragraph28: "With the advances in mobile, cloud and OCR, now is the right time for brands to start capturing the tons of valuable data sitting on receipts. Brands have the ability to create a 360-degree customer view using the purchase history from retail stores. This enables them to run more comprehensive marketing programs that create loyalty across all the customer touch points in the online and offline world. To stay competitive, brands need to reward consumers with a unified experience for their purchase of products and ongoing loyalty. It is important to make it seamless and simple for consumers to earn points for purchases. Smart and efficinet receipt processing enables brands to leverage different kinds of marketing programs ranging from sweepstakes & contests, loyalty programs, rebates and retailer-specific promotions. When done well, this is what would set brands apart from their competitors and create long lasting customer loyalty.",

If you cannot show your customers targeted, personalized results that solve their problem, you will quickly lose them to a plethora of other options that they have on their fingertips. In today’s connected world, users have more choices than ever and if you cannot quickly and accurately give them what they need, your competitors would. These disappointed users will probably never return to your service. Bad search relevance essentially translates to bad service.",
        paragraph30: "Good search results, on the other hand, keep users on the product and get them hooked. They fall in love with what they see and discover. This results in a far superior user experience, engagement, and loyalty. Improving relevance is a long-term investment.

        paragraph32: "Your goal should be to provide your users with the most comprehensive and relevant search results possible. If there is relevant data available, you want to ensure it can be found quickly and easily. Essentially, you have to be very good at telling the difference between good and bad matches. You also want to quickly and accurately identify and eliminate incorrect data, spam, predatory offers, duplicate listings or misleading information from your search results. With better data shown to users, you will see an increase in time spent on your product, repeat visits and number of searches performed.",
        paragraph33: "You need to evaluate search against well-defined metrics and outcomes to scientifically and statistically measure the performance of your search optimization efforts. Every experiment that your product, engineering, data science and machine learning teams undertake with changes in Elasticsearch, Solr or Lucene should be tracked, monitored, measured and analyzed closely across well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs). The search quality team needs to eventually measure which changes translated into happier and more profitable customers – and then invest more in those initiatives. You need to improve your machine learning algorithms based on measurement of search results. If you are not measuring results and analyzing them, you are driving in the dark based on gut feeling - which in most cases turns out to be wrong.",

This is why you need to use humans-in-the-loop with machines to create high quality training data sets and ask them to judge search results. This will help improve the precision of your models over time and the relevancy will automatically adapt to changes in user behavior.",
        paragraph35: "You should build a process to ask human judges to score quality of search results against a query. These metrics will help you compare the performance of difference search algorithms, understand how humans think about searching on your product, and identify specific areas for improvement.",
        paragraph36: "The judgment process is subjective, and different people will make different choices. To solve this problem, you need to ask multiple people to assess the same results to get an average score. It is critical that you partner with a vendor whose human judges do not game the system by answering fast and erroneously. There are several techniques to identify bad human judges. One common technique is to randomly inject questions where you know what the relevance score should be, and then check that the judges answer most of those correctly. Another technique is to review the input from judges who consistently answer differently from other judges for the same tasks. Having this process in place will help you avoid poor quality and misleading training data.",

For example, Netflix uses AI to recommend personalized movies to watch. Amazon.com surfaces customized product recommendations based on your search and purchase history so you know what to buy next. Facebook and Instagram use algorithms to suggest friends and customize newsfeeds to help grow your social network and push relevant content. Google uses ML for better ad targeting and search result ranking. Innovators in manufacturing industry are using AI for supply and demand simulation to optimize inventory and operations.

Data can now be gathered and stored at low costs on cloud storage from services like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Compute power and speed has got a lot better with GPUs performing faster than standard CPUs. Machine learning models can now run in hours leveraging multiple GPUs on a grid of cheap servers. The wide adoption of connected IoT devices and sensors is increasing data by huge magnitude. ML platforms and frameworks will continue to advance and make it easier to create models without being an expert at algorithms and AI technology. This current momentum has already led to AI getting a lot of attention and investment dollars. The coming together of these forces at the same time is helping the AI ecosystem grow at a fast pace.",
        paragraph42: "The most common use case for machine learning is supervised learning which is an input-output mapping. You feed in the algorithm input data and it learns from this mapping to predict results on new data. This approach has been used successfully for use cases such as spam email detection, qualifying loan applicants based on attributes that match past history, and so on. Over the last few years, there have been significant advances in machines being able to sort through unstructured data like images, audio and video. Detection of objects in images has become fairly accurate and at times catches things that the human eye may miss. Translating text into audio, and between languages has also advanced considerably.",
        paragraph43: "To get started with machine learning, you need to identify existing data sets and prepare it to be used for training the algorithms. Companies have tons of structured data in their internal analytical and transactional databases. This data set is the easiest and quickest to use as input for training neural networks and deep learning models in areas like product recommendations, personalization and fraud detection. You have to make sure you give the correct data as input if you want the training to produce high quality outcome. ",

This helps catch any misjudgments made by algorithms and also provides constant learning to help improve the accuracy of ML models.",
        paragraph47: "Data is critical to achieve high levels of accuracy of the ML models and improve quality of predictions. The training data used to make algorithms work as intended needs to be typically cleansed, labeled and enriched before it can be ready to do its job. There is just no substitute for quality and depth of data used for training algorithms. Without properly labeled and organized large data sets, you will end up with incorrect or biased recommendations. The human-computer interaction is much more important for artificial intelligence than we normally think. Artificial intelligence depends on machine learning, which in turn relies on high quality training data. Machine learning algorithms can predict outcomes only as good as the data they train on and need new training data continually to improve and update their models in order to achieve high accuracy.",

This will allow your AI experts to focus on writing sophisticated algorithms instead of grappling with cleaning and preparing data.",
        paragraph50: "We believe in a future where humans and machines will work together harmoniously. We need to leverage AI to augment humans so we can all be more productive, creative and happier. It has to be partnership. Humans can work with computers to analyze the patterns found and come up with actionable insights and interpretations. Computers predict based on past learning. This is where human judgment is critical to help see if the outcome needs to be changed if the base parameters or future scenario has changed. Tomorrow’s industry leaders will be organizations who will be smart to use AI along with humans to innovate faster and make every process run in an efficient manner through increased productivity. The good news is that we are still in the early days of AI and there is a lot of advancement and progress ahead of us. The consumer will be the eventual winner and will benefit from a far superior and personalized experience at lower price points – and that is what excites us!",

Things fall through, people give up, servers’ crash, and there will be times when nothing would go right. You're going to have to deal with it and handle it while keeping your calm. Nothing beats resilience and humility when working on building an organization that lasts. Hear our startup story from our founder.",
        paragraph53: "My name is Kunal. I am the founder of Arcgate, which is an 2000 person strong IT and BPO services outsourcing company headquartered in Udaipur. We started back in year 2005 in Austin, Texas in the US and since then we have grown organically. We haven’t raised any outside funding and we’ve built a pretty good team of people who are passionate about working with high growth startups and helping them with lot of their backend business process outsourcing needs and we feel we’re in a pretty unique position to continue the growth and keep having fun.",
        paragraph54: "You don’t really need inspiration. I think you have to see pain point and something which inspires yourself and if you feel the need is there, go for it. You don’t need to look for any big role model or any big…you know Steve Jobs kind of stories to inspire yourself.",
        paragraph55: "Your day is always made up of setbacks; good times and bad times. So the day you are not having a setback, you should question; “Is something wrong?”, because without setbacks you can’t progress, which means you are not taking enough risk, you are not doing the right things and your people are not either telling you something or business is not going in the direction it needs to. So setbacks are always part of the process. Of course, when we started in 2005...you know the infrastructure in a place like Udaipur, the internet connectivity to power backup to whatever…we had to create everything from scratch. We started when dial up modems were still around. So those are the times when we started. So there were hiccups or issues pretty much every day, right in terms of delivery, getting things done which you know lot of people starting today do not have to face or take for granted, but you know there are always different kinds of challenges. So if you are starting today, you’ll face different sets of issues, problems and that’s where I think, the lesson to be learnt from Jeff Bezos at Amazon, he says it very nicely, that a startup progresses in every 10 years so I think anyone in India looking to make a quick million within a year or two, you should rethink and probably get a job.",
        paragraph56: "There really isn’t any success mantra. I think you take one day at a time and you keep progressing, keep having fun, make sure you and your team are moving forward and you are executing and everyone is growing along with the vision. I think once you do that, success kind of follows itself. You don’t start of saying you want to be successful or you want to…you know make a couple of million or sell the company. I think that’s the wrong way to approach a company, a startup which is going to grow aggressively over the next 5-10 years. So I think it's better not to have those brand visions and think about success INITIALLY because that will get you delusional and feeling low fairly quickly because in a startup, you’ll have more challenges than successes. So I think success follows is the net result but you shouldn’t really have a mantra or you shouldn’t be getting into all those kind of things.",
        paragraph57: "The focus point initially and which stays today is making sure we are doing the right things for the clients because the startup community in the US is very mature, unlike India which is very new and the founders and the executive teams of startups are always looking at each other for references for how things are working with vendors all over the world. So our goals is always to make sure we are a trusted partner, do the best we can for every customer. That way there is a trust; there is a reputation and the growth kind of follows along with that. So I think that’s the main goal and the vision when we’re working with the outsourcing in an area like startups in the US which is very challenging, very demanding at the same time, very fulfilling when it works out.",
        paragraph58: "So, I think any time you are starting a company or you’re athlete or preparing over the years before you make it to the Olympics or whatever the top segment is, you have to sacrifice, you have to put in lot of work, you have to work over weekends, nights, or sacrifice family time and personal time, not take holidays. So I think all that goes with the territory and I think you have to make that personal choice and decision whether you want to have that lifestyle or not because from outside you know every industry, whether it is entertainment or sports or business looks very glamorous and easy. I think once you get into it, you want to be successful; you’ll be willing to roll up your sleeves, do the hard work and make sure you are in for the long run because it will take… I’d say 5-10 years before you to see some results and maybe you won’t see result. You have to be ready for the failure and ready to take it in the right swing and move on. We started with 2 person team, sitting in office in a garage, next to where I live. So, from there to where we are today, it’s you know there are lot of benefits, right. We have done lot of good and created lot of employment opportunities, that’s the biggest benefit to the local community. There are lots of people who’ve grown from very beginning, entry level stage to 10-12 years now to a much more mature experience role. So those are the benefits or the things which give me pleasure when you see that kind of growth. I think creating industry in a place like Udaipur, creating IT-BPO and this is still the start...we feel there is a lot of opportunity room to grow. I think those are all the pluses. In terms of the journey...like I said growing from 2 to 1800 is always going to be challenging. It’s never easy in terms of funding, making sure you are profitable, making sure you are doing the right things, customer deliveries, top notch, the people are happy, you are hiring the right people especially in a place like Udaipur, attracting talent from other places. So I think those all are the challenges. But I think you know if you execute day in and day out, it typically works out okay.",
        paragraph59: "I think this year is going well, there’s no issue. Challenges with the global economy, the slowing growth rates in India, so on and so forth. But those are always there, they is some external or internal fact that which are challenging or bring problems along the way and I think what we’ve done over the last twelve plus years is we’ve gone through 2008 financial crisis, we’ve gone through a lot of ups and downs in the broader economy, we have survived and kept growing. So we kind of know the formula and its very simple stick to the basics, do the work, make sure delivery is top notch and people are growing and executing well. So I think once you do all the basics, things fall in place. So I think this year is no different. It is going well and we continue to grow and do well. We are expanding and all good things coming down the road.",
        paragraph60: "I think new generation of entrepreneurs in India, I think the message would be fairly straight forward, “Do it if you are passionate, if you are IN for the long run, don’t do it for the wrong reasons which typically ends up being money or fame or trying to make it to the media or get some coverage because those typically don’t happen. If they happen, you go out, raise funding as you’ve seen with lot of flipkarts of the world; you dilute yourself to the quick, and the board ends up firing you and you basically look back at years of not accomplishing much. So I think, if you are starting off today, don’t get into it for the wrong reasons because that’s typically what I see the younger generation trying to do it just because they want to become the next Flipkart or Amazon or Google. But you gotta understand, for every success story, there are probably thousands of failures and to get to success, there is lot of hard work. That will take like I said decade or two decade of hard work before you see results and maybe you won’t, so I think once you understand that and enter that with a passion and approach which is mature, you should be okay.",

However, in this modern age of entrepreneurship, location did not stop him from starting Arcgate in Udaipur and dreaming big! In fact, he used it to his advantage. He moved back from the US to start Arcgate, in Udaipur – his hometown, where he wanted to stay put and in doing so, he also created opportunities for young professionals who could now do what they love with the advantage of being closer to their families and in a city with a better quality of life (think less traffic, more parks, lesser commute time..). Although not everything has been hunky-dory in getting where we are today – as we all understand that recruiting is hard with a smaller population, but that did not stop him from following his heart – he honed his pitch to hire and recruit from the talent of pool of surrounding and neighboring cities as well.

Food and beverage industry is also leveraging AI for profound transformations such as to improve food consumption, precision farming, personalized nutrition services, optimize operations, and deliver a better customer experience. For example, there are apps now, which act as a personal diet coach. Users have to simply log what they have eaten in order to get personalized nutritional advice and also to estimate the amount of calorie intake. An innovative approach to logistics with the use of AI technology can change the course of food delivery by scheduling deliveries, managing vendors and inventory, or paying bills; thus making every step in the workflow efficient and fast.",
        paragraph71: "Predictive analytics and machine learning together can solve many issues and can make food delivery more efficient by forecasting preferred meals by location, or hour of the day, game seasons etc. AI in conjunction with data analysis techniques can increase efficiency, broaden the reach, make advance recommendations, help with new product development and improve consumer engagement. Companies are using machine learning algorithms to determine user’s ideal diet, along with speed and image recognition to estimate nutritional content of a meal from a photo; which in turn can help consumers save time while logging their meals. This will encourage users to quickly enter more data, and is more likely to track their behavior and analyze the invaluable data. It can help plan weekly meals according to dietary preferences, demonstrate cooking tutorials, supervise the pantry, organize shopping lists, and arrange grocery delivery.",
        paragraph72: "AI, food databases and analysis combined together can help in chalking out tailor made nutritional patterns, and companies can compete to be more transparent, traceable and trustworthy in their delivery of healthier, more sustainable and more delicious foods. Technological advances have made on-demand food ordering possible and the industry is pivoting towards more innovative approaches in logistics to meet and exceed customer expectations seamlessly across multiple channels. Today vast quantities of data is generated in the food industry from numerous resources which includes data from point-of-sale transactions, staffing needs, restaurant reservations, delivery service records, managing vendors, inventory and paying bills. In the field of AI, more data equals better learning, which is precisely why startups are focusing on that. In fact, predictive analytics is an essential business technology and is critical to success in competitive markets. As a result, artificial intelligence is making its way into the food and beverage industry and it is vitally important for companies to consider how AI can work for them or risk being left behind. AI can help the industry tap into consumer sentiment to offer new products and services before the consumers even realize they need it.",

        paragraph74: "United States is the world's biggest consumer of oil. In 2016, the daily consumption was approximately 19 million barrels of oil, or 6.9 billion barrels for the entire year. This consumption rate is almost double that of the next highest consumer of oil (China), and is more than the next three consumers combined. United States is also one of the biggest importers of oil. In 2016, Unites States imported approximately 10.2 million barrels of oil per day from multiple countries. The top five petroleum import sources for the U.S. in 2016 were Canada, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico, and Colombia. It is important to note that America's import of petroleum products has been declining over the years. The imports have fallen by nearly 40% from their peak in 2005. The major reason for this decline is an increase in domestic oil and gas production. So how did the US achieve this?",
        paragraph75: "As the U.S. economy grew, the demand for energy increased exponentially. In 2014, U.S. primary energy consumption was about 18% of the total world energy consumption. Majority of this energy demand is fulfilled by fossil fuels. In 2016, 33% of the U.S. energy production was accounted by natural gas, 28% was accounted by petroleum, and remaining by other sources (coal, renewable, nuclear). It is clear from this data that oil and gas plays a very important role in meeting energy demand of the U.S. Between 1970 and late 1990s, America's need for crude oil soared and domestic oil production failed to meet the rising demand. Things have changed quite a lot since then. Beginning in early 2000s, America's dependence on foreign oil began to decline. To achieve the goal of self-dependency, scientists and engineers worked round the clock to find means of increasing domestic production. Finally, advances were made in two breakthrough technologies, which resulted in explosion of oil production growth in the United States also known as the shale revolution. These two technologies were hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing involves injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals underground at high pressure that cracks the rock to release oil. Horizontal drilling involves drilling a well straight down, and then sideways which made it possible to expose a much greater area of oil bearing rock. Neither of the practices was absolutely new but refining the techniques and combining them transformed the commercial viability of oil. The oil companies are now able to extract oil and gas from layers deep down the earth which were previously inaccessible. This situation led to increased drilling activities like never before. Hundreds of new drilling operators have emerged who are keen to capitalize on this oil boom made possible by the engineering breakthrough.",
        paragraph76: "Increased drilling activity has also led to increased data generation and thus an influx of data analytics companies. On a daily basis, hundreds of oil wells are drilled and terabytes of data is generated. This data is raw and disorganized, but holds immensely valuable information. With increased production and falling oil prices, there is huge pressure on oil companies to reduce the cost of exploration and production. Oil companies are slowly realizing that by leveraging smart data analytics, they can reduce their costs and increase profit margins. The goal of data analytics is mainly to allow oil companies to make better decisions through high-quality, reliable data based on complete, accurate, and easily available information. Though oil companies can manage their own teams to analyze the raw data, it is quite costly and inefficient to divert their resources away from their core business of oil exploration and drilling. This has led to birth of large number of data analytics startups that are collecting the oil and gas data, analyzing it, and creating powerful and user-friendly software to serve oil companies who are desperate to exploit information derived from this massive volume of data.",

For instance, data generated from pumps and other machinery can predict failures of electric submersible pumps. By analyzing video data from cameras along with data from robotic devices, corrosion development of pipes can be predicted. Data from weather and soil can be analyzed to predict operational success of drilling which can have a huge impact on cost and revenues. Similarly, extensive study of various public filings can help locate fields with richest concentration of oil and gas. All such information can help oil companies save millions of dollars. With so much money depending on every output derived from the data, analytic companies are working hard to create the best possible tools that help visualize, predict and discover. The startups that are able to run lean operations, innovate quickly and partner with other players where it makes sense will thrive in the long run.",

A solid outsourcing partnership helps a startup focus on product and customer growth, which results in faster development and sales. Just like all established companies, startups also need to process loads of data required for back office operations, such as a managing listings data for Real Estate Tech startups to keeping restaurant menu data updated for Food Tech startups. For founding teams, striking the balance between growing the product and managing back office processes efficiently quickly becomes frustrating as they onboard new customers.",
        paragraph80: "This is where outsourcing can help startups scale and run effectively. Repetitive, time-consuming back office tasks should be standardized and managed by a trusted and experienced outsourcing partner so internal engineering, sales, marketing and support teams can focus on customer needs and product development.",

When you start off, you need to create a set roadmap to take your product to market, and to do so effectively, you will need to surround yourself with those who can add value to each of the processes, brainstorm on ideas and help you build your product. Outsourcing helps free up your internal resources for the more critical tasks that a startup needs to execute on flawlessly for market growth.",

AI has seeped into our daily lives through the Internet, without many of us even being aware of it. For instance, when an ecommerce website recommends or suggests you products; it is based on your previous purchase patterns and behavior. This is artificial intelligence and its effectiveness is correlated to the availability of relevant data and accurate predictive analysis.",
        paragraph86: "Artificial Intelligence technologies are not only dependent on huge amounts of data, but are only as good as the data they work with or train on. Today there is availability of large data sets be it in forms of images, weather data, logistics data, health data, transactions, etc. and we also have the ability to now process these huge quantities of data which previously required extremely expensive hardware or software systems. And this ease of technology and availability of data is what is enabling AI and machine learning to scale which was otherwise dormant for decades due to lack of availability of data.",
        paragraph87: "There are still limitations to what technology can do. To create sophisticated and valuable algorithms, large data sets are critical. But that is not all – as those large data sets need to be first collected, organized, cleansed, annotated, classified, tagged, labeled etc. for the AI technologies to effectively work. Generally speaking, AI companies and startups all require accurate data for specialized applications and seemingly little things such as classifying, tagging, de-duplicating etc., demand accuracy. Thus, the ability to collect and organize high quality data is not only a prerequisite but plays a key role in determining the competitiveness of high growth companies which are building services on top of artificial intelligence technologies.",


        paragraph88: "Have you ever tried a website or app’s search to find yourself feeling frustrated with the accuracy of the results, so much so, that you exit the site and end up transacting on a competing site that simply did a better job at showing you exactly what you were looking for? Well, we hear you. As it’s something we all experience on a regular basis too – which is nothing but a case of bad search relevancy. As users we get frustrated, whereas for the site publisher it’s a lost opportunity to acquire a customer or a lost sale in case of returning users.",
        paragraph89: "Accurate and relevant search results are not only a science but are an art too. It’s similar to having an extraordinary sales person in your store – your MVP - the one sales associate who is a winner as he’s always around to help the customer. The one who directs the customer exactly to the section where the product they are looking for is available - leading to a quick and a super-smooth sale. So you see, an analogy can easily be drawn between a sales associate and search relevance. For instance, imagine you chanced upon a lazy sales associate in a store. You get annoyed with him for not helping you the right way, but in this case you may approach another sales associate to help you with what you cannot find. Unfortunately though while searching online, when you run into poor search results, you have no such option. You will be left feeling frustrated and most likely are bound to exit and jump off to another site in search for what you were looking for.",
        paragraph90: "We can’t stress enough on how that little “search” field or icon on any product is nothing but a super helpful sales associate. It is one of the primary product discovery and purchase channels for online shoppers. Just like how a helpful sales associate will keep you in the store till you find what you were looking for; accurate and good search relevancy is critical to improving conversions and findability, especially on ecommerce sites in order to keep the users of that site returning for more. Good search results on ecommerce sites, along with a clean navigation user interface and excellent recommendations, not only provides for a better user experience, but also lowers the exit rates and increases the purchase intent.",
        paragraph91: "Thus, site search, if not fully optimized will cause users to jump off and head to a competitor’s website where it’s easier to find what they want. Yes, we do understand that maintaining an accurate search relevancy is an ongoing task – which needs to be tweaked and improved consistently in order to provide for the best search experience possible, yet it cannot be overlooked. Do you want your users to be disappointed or frustrated? If not, think of search relevancy in terms of your customer service – just like how good customer service retains and keeps your customers coming back, similarly your site search with accurate and efficient search relevancy will continue to delight your users with amazing, prompt and accurate results. Hence, building a good site search should be a norm and not an afterthought! ",
        paragraph92: "To improve your search relevancy, you have to constantly improve your artificial intelligence and search algorithms with training data. Additionally, look into investing in the human effort to tag and categorize your content accurately. All this effort will go a long way in helping your data scientists and machine-learning teams to constantly improve the product search quality and accuracy.",
        paragraph93: "So go ahead, do all that it takes to improve your search relevance and see your conversions shoot up!",


        paragraph94: "What we see when we scroll down the our feeds on Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook etc. we get immersed in an endless stream of photos, videos, likes, comments and other updates from our friends, family and acquaintances. All those posts about them vacationing or enjoying a nice lunch somewhere exotic in essence is user generated content - generated by real people, at real places enjoying whatever it is they are posting about. This is content created by you as a user or your friends and family, in the form of posts, comments, photos, videos, reviews etc. We know for a fact that today Facebook itself has over a billion users on its platform – and there are stats showing how many likes, posts, comments, photos, videos etc., it generates in a day - which of course are in millions and billions again. So you can imagine the vastness of this user-generated content that is out there on the big wide world of web or Internet as a whole.",
        paragraph95: "Ok, so you may be wondering where we are going with this. Well, for most part this user generated content works well for users and companies, given we as human beings make decisions, form opinions, and even allow ourselves to be influenced by the things that evoke emotions inside us. However, it is also true that all this user generated content is not always positive. There is little wonder that the vastness of Internet also grants anonymity to people which gives them a choice to behave in ways they would want – so on one side of the spectrum there are people who are sincere, constructive, uplifting etc. and on the other side of spectrum are people who troll, are disgusting or are even dangerous. So what happens, when the same content becomes hateful, abusive or inappropriate?",
        paragraph96: "As a user, as an individual, mostly you can moderate the content you are exposed to. But in case of brands and companies it is important to protect online reputation when users are reviewing, talking and sharing about you openly. Whether it’s social networks, blogs, websites, etc., they need somebody to monitor and quickly remove any inappropriate content to provide a clean and safe platform for its users to enjoy their services. Simply put – companies and brands need to have a plan and strategy in place to monitor and moderate this user generated content 24/7.",
        paragraph97: "Positive user generated content boosts credibility and increases trusts, so it is paramount that whether you are a company, brand or an online store to be vigilant about your content moderation. For instance, let’s take an example of user generated reviews: most of your customers or community members engage with positive and credible reviews about your services or products, which in return promote trust and social proof along with creating excitement amongst other users or consumers engaging with products and services that you offer. But then there are countless haters and spammers out there who spend their time actively trying to defame your company by posting negative reviews, inappropriate photos, videos and in some cases illegal content disparaging your products and services, which you put in your heart and soul to build. Believe us, when we say this: at times it takes only one person to tarnish your company’s reputation just when you think your hard work which went into building it was about to pay off. And hence, content moderation is the only solution to tackle this problem effectively.",
        paragraph98: "In fact, content moderators are a necessity in today’s day and age. Yes, of course, we have technology to help us in content moderation, but because of the nature of this content, what we really need are content moderation specialists who are experts at detecting new patterns of scammers, fake profiles, abusive content, illegal products etc. Yes technology equips us with automation, which makes it easy to scan through content for basic quality needs, but to handle the complexity and to check for appropriateness of most types of content - a human touch is required! If you are running a platform, the human input helps with machine learning and improved automation to detect bad content.",
        paragraph99: "It’s true that user generated content if positive can be a pot of gold for marketers, brands and companies alike; but it’s not exactly a secret too that unmoderated content can run the risk of significant brand attacks and loss of revenue for your company or organization. So establish your content guideline, tune in to technology and combine it with a great team of moderators to kick in your best and most effective content moderation strategy.",


        paragraph100: "In today’s data-driven world – what will be the future of adtech and martech? A significant union is prevalent between advertising and marketing technologies – so does that mean there will be more consolidations between adtech and martech startups? Or dominant players like Facebook and Google will continue to lead the digital advertising and online marketing landscape? Wish we knew the answers to all those and more! Here are just some of our thoughts on what could be a few of the hot or not-so-hot trends in adtech / martech.",
        paragraph102: "First things first - to stay ahead of the curve, both advertisers and marketers, will have to move towards programmatic technologies to optimize the potential data and make intelligent use of big data and artificial intelligence. This layered with location, contextual, behavioral, and all the other user data will provide predictions based on how, when and who is the right audience for their brands.",
        paragraph103: "Since it’s all about improving the experience for the customers who are increasingly characterized by data captured and real time analytics to better identify, target, deliver and measure the results of their campaigns - adtech and martech companies - should consider a few straight forward actions like:",
        bulletPoints5: [
            "Make ads less intrusive – and focus more on search, sponsored content, social channels, custom ads etc.",
            "Invest heavily in content creation, especially creatives and dynamic videos.",
            "With the right programmatic technologies track and monitor right analytics to filter out impressions (humans versus bots).",
        ],
        paragraph104: "And then to keep up with the evolving challenges of today’s adtech/martech landscape build more sophisticated tools and innovate to combat such challenges. A few ways to do that would be:",
        paragraph105: "Master Cross-Device Tracking and Targeting - Advertisers today know that their audience is more likely to bounce from mobile to desktop to tablets and hence, mastering cross device success is not just about delivering ads across all those devices; but it is about tracking and measuring the delivery in order to build the full profile of the user and gather insights by monitoring engagement and actions to attribute it to consumer experience and patterns.",
        paragraph106: "Personalized and Relevant Messaging - The vast pool of content across different devices and channels creates a noise where it is very easy for consumers to often ignore or miss the relevant brand message. And in order to capture the audience’s attention – it is imperative that brands drive the right message at the right time tailored to that one consumer – such relevant messaging / ads are less intrusive and they play into the consumers’ need for personalization, thus increasing the conversion rate.",
        paragraph107: "Emphasize on Engagement more than Reach - While measuring both engagement and reach are important for brands; reach alone doesn’t guarantee a loyal consumer base. It is important for your audience to act and engage with your content - as without engagement, there is little chance of leveraging that relationship to convert into a lead or sale.",
        paragraph108: "Advanced and Better Analytics for Better Decision Making - No longer can marketing decisions be taken on intuition alone and hence there is a huge leap in developing tools for digital analytics. With so much data available, marketers have to develop more sophisticated tools to obtain information on how the consumers interact, nurture and communicate with the brands. Advanced digital analytics tools will support, better, faster and more fact-based decision making.",
        paragraph109: "Native Advertising to combat Ad Blocking - Ad blocking is an existential crisis for the advertising industry. With ad blocking on the rise, consumers (if annoyed with advertising) can hide or block it. In order to overcome that challenge, adtech companies should adapt native advertising – since most of these native ads are blended in content and are not fully susceptible to ad blockers which doesn’t intrude the consumer and blends into consumer’s experience who in turn may engage with it due to its relevance. Native advertising when done right can add value to the publisher, consumer and of course the brand!",
        paragraph110: "So here we are - with our thoughts together on what we think are the trends that will shape the adtech / martech industry in the near future. However, having said that, we are not oblivious to the fact that the advancements which are taking shape in the virtual and augmented reality space will witness some new and exciting trends amongst the adtech /martech innovators. Let’s stay tuned for more!",

        paragraph1A: "In a customer driven market, excellent customer support is key to success. When you provide an awesome customer support experience, you are actually working to set yourself apart from your competition by delighting your customer. And the faster you are able to delight your customer, the sooner you are creating a sticky consumer experience and making it hard for the customer to walk away.",
        paragraph1B: "Customer support done right can save you a lot of money and directly translates to more revenue. Think marketing costs – a good customer experience will result in good recommendations and word-of-mouth publicity for your product or service. And that itself makes for a pretty solid case for doing customer support right! Great support lets you keep customers at a cost way cheaper than getting new ones. Acquiring a customer definitely costs more than retaining one, and hence it is imperative to have a system in place to retain existing clients. Agree, right?!",
        paragraph1C: "So what makes for a “delightful” customer support? Well, we say start right off the bat! In other words, ensure proper onboarding – don’t wait for your customer to get frustrated trying to figure out how to use your product or service. This is your touchpoint where the customer relationship can go wrong, as the customer needs the most information and support as they begin to engage with your product or experience your service. At the same time, make sure you don’t abandon your customer after you finish your sale. There are numerous studies that clearly show that customers are willing to spend more with companies that provide excellent after sale service and support.",
        paragraph1D: "Put emphasis on both reactive and proactive approaches for your customer support. With reactive we mean – make your customer complaints your top priority! Acknowledge, agree and react to provide the best solution. And mind you, it doesn’t end there. Follow up to ensure the solution provided helped the customer and all is taken care of now. Well, so that was focusing on your reactive approach. Time to look into your proactive approach – Make the first move! Yes, you have a customer onboard; now don’t wait for them to contact you at the time of an issue. If you detect a problem, reach out to your customer before they do and offer the solution. Now, that’s also building customer loyalty at the same time.",
        paragraph1E: "We don’t need to point out the obvious that makes for a great customer support experience – and we won’t elaborate on those too but here is a quick take on it - personalize your communication with your customers, respond to their email and phone calls promptly and never miss an opportunity to add value wherever you can and as much as possible. Pursue their valuable feedback, ask for suggestions – it will not only give you a chance to fix a problem you may have not realized, but would also help you improvise your product or service with their valuable feedback and suggestions.",
        paragraph1F: "Now with all those efforts, you have fueled your customer with euphoria! A delightful customer is more than likely to talk about your products with friends, family, on social media and across their networks. So there you go - here is our case in point of delighting your customers with an exceptional customer support and our reason is simple – a delighted customer will always choose you over your competitor and in turn will bring in more new customers by spreading the delight in their communities.",


        paragraph1G: "As a business owner, focusing on the quality of your marketing campaigns, leads and customer relationships should be fundamental to optimizing your sales process, outreach efforts and demand generation. The quality of the contacts data is a key component of the buyer funnel in any business. When it comes to data on your prospects, it’s not only about numbers, but also about accurate information to help you get to the right decision maker. Low quality leads end up wasting your sale organization’s time on research, data collection and chasing stale leads. On the other hand, high quality leads facilitate smarter targeting, segmentation and marketing automation.",
        paragraph1H: "In our experience, B2B sales and marketing databases decay over time. Your business contacts data gets out of date sooner than you realize. When your contact database is not actively enriched and cleansed, your sales teams do not realize the full potential from their email marketing and outbound calling efforts due to high bounce rates. Eventually they end up doing their own research on LinkedIn, Google, ZoomInfo and other tools. This doesn’t help your organization’s growth goals since you would rather have your star sales reps closing deals instead of building prospect lists. ",
        paragraph1I: "Your contact database is always in flux. People are hired and fired. Companies shut down or get acquired. New positions are created. Businesses fail and succeed every quarter. People are always on the move to better or different opportunities. Thus not only does an organization need to make a constant effort to grow their CRM database with new accounts and contacts to prospect; but they also in parallel need to keep updating the existing data to make sure it is accurate and targeted.",
        paragraph1J: "Lead generation is the first step; lead enrichment is an ongoing process that should not be ignored. After all, how effective is your sales strategy if you are still nurturing a contact at a company who no longer works there or is not the right decision maker? Thus, it is imperative for today’s highly competitive sales and marketing teams to have access to accurate and updated customer data to run an efficient outbound sales operation.",
        paragraph1K: "You can look out for a few indicators that would tell you if your CRM database is in dire need of lead enrichment:",
        bulletPoints6: [
            "What is your email bounce rate? How many emails bounced back from your last email campaign?",
            "How many of your emails get auto replies which are not “out of office replies.” Was your email delivered? The person you were email nurturing may have left the company and the “undeliverable” email will not even show up in your bounce report.",
            "Is your team reaching out to prospects on personal emails? Well, pull that list out and enrich those Gmail, Yahoo and others free personal emails with business emails.",
            "When was the last time your team got in touch with a prospective contact? If it has been more than 6 months then it’s highly probable that the contact person may have changed or has a new position in the company.",
            "If your “lead” hasn’t responded even after repeatedly attempts then there can be two possibilities a) they are clearly not interested. b) You may have the wrong contact information.",
        ],
        paragraph1L: "As startups grow and ramp up their sales teams, it is important to set up a dedicated lead generation and enrichment support team. You can set up your own team of interns, temp workers or full-time researchers in-house or partner with a company that does it well. Whichever route you go, if you manage this process tightly and refine it as you measure the results, it will help you close new accounts.",


        paragraph1M: "Ecommerce is driven by technology, but there’s still a lot of work that people have to do. Someone has to write product descriptions, upload product images, create listings, provide customer support, and manage accounts and marketing and much more. However, of all these tasks – product description, classification, categorization and navigation are a backbone for successful marketing, discovery and sale of products listed on ecommerce sites, be it the likes of Amazon, eBay, Craigslist or any other.",
        paragraph1N: "Classification plays an important part in product discovery on any ecommerce site or marketplace; hence it is extremely crucial that the products are listed in accurate categories. Most of the ecommerce marketplaces have a large number of business users list their products and expect to find buyers for their products that come in all sorts of colors, sizes, brands, prices etc. It is pivotal to get this categorization right in ecommerce as it helps consumers find what they are looking to buy.",
        paragraph1O: "Navigation is incredibly important for online retail success. It sounds pretty obvious and straight forward, but if customers cannot find what they want to buy on the website, chances are, they will walk away without buying any stuff. Not only bad product categorization, but poor product photography and poor product descriptions are conversion killers. However, these are issues that all ecommerce players have a control over, yet many of them still end up losing on their sales because it is not done correctly and effectively. Good product categorization drives conversions, retention and growth. So improving your product photography, product description and product classification can increase the findability significantly, which means, your customers can easily find what they are looking for on your site. Ecommerce sites or a marketplace which fail to convert some of their customers is simply because they ignore or lack good product meta data.",
        paragraph1P: "We believe that a clear and well thought-out product categorization, a good navigation, high quality product photography and great product description are key drivers to conversion. If your customers cannot find it; they cannot buy it. Most customers looking to buy anything online begin their search by browsing through product categories and if you as an online retailer get this wrong, it results in a poor first impression and frustrating shopping experience for your customers.",


        paragraph1Q: "As technology advances at breakneck speed, our lives are becoming increasingly digitized. From Facebook feeds to sensor data to smart devices, companies are collecting a massive pool of big data yet starving for actionable insights and information. Big Data which is set to transform society is at the foundation of all the mega trends that are happening today, from social to mobile to cloud to gaming. Most likely, you've heard a lot of the talk about the volume, variety and velocity of big data and how challenging it is to keep up with that explosion of data.",
        paragraph1R: "This huge pool of data comes from everywhere: sensors used to gather weather information, posts to social media sites, digital pictures and videos, purchase transaction records, and cellphone GPS signals to name a few. However for the purpose of this blog we will divide the key driving factors for contributing to this tsunami of data as: interactions, transactions, and automation.",
        paragraph1S: "Data generated through interactions is mostly from social media, search engines, electronic yellow pages, emails, texts, Facebook likes, user generated contents, blogs etc. Basically, this covers any data generated through communication and interpersonal interactions and a fair amount of this kind of data is unstructured.",
        paragraph1T: "Data generated through transactions is mostly structured data and examples of which can be invoices, travel itineraries, payments, company records etc. This kind of data can exist within organizations in ERP's, CRM's, etc. along with many other business processes and events.",
        paragraph1U: "Data generated through automation is mostly Internet of things (IoT), which includes smart devices, vehicles, sensors, and many other items which are embedded with software and network connectivity that collects and exchanges data. Some examples of this include GPS coordinates from a person that visits a website on their mobile phone, or RFID chips in debit / credit cards etc.",
        paragraph1V: "Today there is data available on how many steps customers took, how many products they compared, and what attributes they focused on, such as price, features, brand comparisons, recommendations, defects, and so on. Talking about all this data also makes us wonder about what are the vantage points for collecting, and categorizing this data.",
        paragraph1W: "A few we tried to put together are as follows:",
        paragraph1X: "Our location has become an integral part of our phones, smart watches, and every other connected device we carry. New technology is learning to adapt to us and using our location data to get more and more responsive, useful and intuitive. Our smartphones ability to pinpoint our exact location and for companies to use that piece of information as an actionable insight to deliver services - a meal, a cab ride, a deal coupon - is a reason for excitement.",
        paragraph1Y: "As products become increasingly electronic, for example: heart monitoring implants, automobiles with sensors, wearable devices etc., they collect a lot of useful data with the help of valuable technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) may sound like a consumer fantasy come true -- who wouldn't want to be able to turn on the lights at home from a few miles away, or leave it to their refrigerator to make sure they know when milk, butter need to be replenished? But there's more to the IoT than lifestyle enhancement. It also includes a corporate side, enabling organizations to collect and analyze data from sensors on manufacturing equipment, pipelines, weather stations, smart meters, delivery trucks, and many other types of industrial machines etc.",
        paragraph1Z: "As consumers we love our healthy oatmeal cookies. But as a company, a service provider, an advertiser, a product seller etc., they all love web cookies to create a profile for our online activities.

        paragraph2B: "Now, there's the data dash! All this data may be structured, unstructured or semi- structured data, but organizing this data and analyzing it can allow us to learn an incredible amount about ourselves and society-at-large. With the digital age still in its infancy, we are just beginning to mine and refine the massive pool of data accumulated from our smart phones, wearable devices, internet activity, and internet of things. The practices to collect and organize data for actionable insights is getting better and better each year, and we are moving towards a future where brands, companies and governments would know what we want and need before we even know it ourselves!",

This is enabling real estate management firms, owners and brokers to make better real-time decisions based on business intelligence and analytics resulting from quantified and qualified data.",
        paragraph2D: "The key challenge facing the real estate sector is to change the archaic system of managing information primarily with spreadsheets, PDFs and paper documents. Being a very data-centric industry, real estate has its fair share of challenges such as real-time updates on properties already rented, current listings and upcoming vacant listings. Many real estate brokers are still stuck with traditional ways of keeping track of prospects and properties, which results in a lot of their time going into managing data instead of focusing on actual deal flow. There is also a gap in data availability and interpretation of information in a standardized manner between different parties. This makes it tougher for brokers and property managers to decipher and understand the information they have at hand.",
        paragraph2E: "Startups are working on solutions to help the industry overcome inconsistencies that result from poorly maintained data. Along with software, it is imperative to engage a team of skilled and trained data analysts to constantly research, clean and enrich data. The data management team needs to use a standard set of terminology to simplify and feed clean, transformed and mapped data into the software enabling end users to search and report on good data. Higher quality and more complete data results in better reporting, analysis and decision-making.",
        paragraph2F: "Accurate data available in a common database helps brokers, owners, clients, and other key players to better collaborate not only with colleagues, but with various other stakeholders as well.

        paragraph2L: "When it comes to big data, it beats the traditional methods of analysis by allowing us to process as much information as we want and quickly! It allows companies to work backwards by first collecting the required data for analysis and then deriving conclusions based on the patterns.",
        paragraph2M: "However, this huge pool of data comes with its own set of problems. The larger the data, the more likely it is to have errors and noise, thus making it imperative that data scientists take time to carefully clean the data before using it for any analysis.",

Hence, analysis of this data is making it possible to not just understand the present, but to also make precise and accurate predictions about the future. One of the key benefits of analysis of this big data is prediction in the form of probabilities.",
        paragraph2Q: "Correlation is not causation which means just because two factors are correlated does not necessarily means that one causes the other. However, correlations and trends are extremely useful for anyone trying to make a prediction about future circumstances. Big data moves us away from creating this causal link, and helps us see the data more clearly, and allows the data to speak for itself. Therefore, helping us discover correlations that one would have never looked for.",
        paragraph2R: "What’s the point of all that data, anyway? It’s to make decisions. Analysis of big data will help businesses find strategic answers to essential questions. For instance, in today’s competitive environment, businesses will benefit from big data by linking useful transactional data, and layering in social consumer behavior to arrive at analytic-based decisions.",
        paragraph2S: "This is just the beginning. The amount of data that surrounds us is becoming a key competitive edge, and the companies with the greatest access to data, will win over those who do not. Data oriented companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook are expected to continue innovating in this space. Large traditional players such as Walmart, Target, Nestle and others are also making investments in big data initiatives to start collecting and analyzing data to improve consumer targeting. The valuation of companies such as Facebook where users are generating massive amount of big data would continue to increase due to the value of the information they are sitting on.",
        paragraph2T: "There is big value in big data, which in turn has led way to the rise of data owners, data entrepreneurs and data analysts who crunch, clean and convert the data into useable information. Data owners and data entrepreneurs are now seeking opportunities in reusing, merging or combining the data they are holding on to, and so there has been a growth in companies who now ‘broker’ other company’s data sets.",

Yes, they “do-it-all” - right from preparing gourmet meals, sell recipes and dinner kits, to delivering it, and building out all the enabling technology.

So are we saying this model is easily scalable? Well, no! But is it scalable? Definitely, yes! This model also has room for new players, who can create a niche of any kind. Be it health food, be it organic, or be it vegan etc. It’s more like creating a “food cult!” Whereas, the “only” food delivery business is far more easily scalable given a much lower capital (than the “do-it-all” model) to scale the business. However, here the margins will be thin since the revenue model is mostly in the form of commissions from tied-up restaurants and delivery charges. Hence, the growth will purely rely on increasing volume through consistent delivery - constantly acquiring new customers and retaining the existing one’s for repeat orders. This model will see players who have the best logistics and extremely sophisticated data-driven software take the market share. The winners would leverage technology to gather the best data insights, reduce delivery times by mapping the best route, allow customers to track their orders in real time with accurate estimated delivery time, and enable restaurants to increase sales. Well, with all that said – the least that can be said is – it will be an interesting space to watch and follow!

Despite the effectiveness of digital OOH, the medium doesn't yet have a standard place in the ad agency structure. Many in the industry tend to lump DOOH under other categories, such as traditional OOH, as opposed to giving it its own line on the budget. The other factor affecting pricing is the lack of a uniform way of planning and placing ads.

Delivery of messages and ads will be more effective in the future as there is technology advances.

For instance, a restaurant can allow customers to upload a photo of your meal with a message that can be displayed on a digital display and then shared with their friends on Facebook.",
            'Revenue models are increasingly becoming more attractive as hardware prices per-screen continues to drop. Overall, prices have deflated by approximately 30% over the past few years.

This creates brand awareness as well as customer relationship management opportunities. There is an increased reach for a product or service with digital signage, and social media enables a higher level of engagement. Through social - texts, downloads, mobile browsing, sharing, voice - there is great potential to increase foot traffic to locations and web traffic to sites, thus increasing in-person, web, and mobile purchases.

Part of the problem is that ROI is not fully understood. Another problem is new networks are cropping up at a fast pace. This makes it tough for agencies and marketers to fully understand and keep track of the media available to them or even to understand the benefits of what one network offers over another. According to Adcentricity, 70% of all network sales are from local sales efforts, driven by the network sales staff.

Incubators, startup competitions and networking events where entrepreneurs can demo their products and ideas have started to be organized across the country. The support from the government has added fuel to the entrepreneurship drive. Angel investors, Venture Capital and Private equity firms have also started showing interest in the startup businesses and putting in big money behind ideas that have the market potential and the right team.",
        paragraph4P: 'Any new company in India has to be registered with "The Registrar of Companies (ROC)", the government body that manages incorporation and administration of companies. In India, incorporation of a company is governed by the Companies Act 1956, which empowers the Central Government to regulate the formation, financing, functioning and closing of companies. The Companies Act does not apply to universities, co-operative societies, and scientific and other societies. The Act is administered by the Central Government through the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Offices of Registrar of Companies, Official Liquidators, Public Trustee, Company Law Board and Director of Inspection. Private companies are registered with the Registrar of Companies in each state and you have to contact the registrar’s office to access data on private companies since its not available online. Finding information on startups that may be incorporated as "Proprietorship" or "Partnership" firms is even more difficult.',
        paragraph4Q: 'The traditional method of raising capital for startups in India was to reach out to family and friends. However, with US based VC and PE firms setting up shop in India over the last couple of years, this trend is changing. There used to be an "Electronic Data Information Filing and Retrieval (EDIFAR)" website maintained by the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) that maintained filings and funding data. This website has been discontinued and replaced by the Corporate Filing and Dissemination System (CFDS) that was put in place jointly by the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and National Stock Exchange (NSE). However, only information on publicly traded companies is available in this database. Thus if you want to research funding information in India, you have to find on your own by digging through Investors sections of startup websites and following technology news sources such as Techcrunch, GigaOm, CNET, Indian web startup and Startup Dunia. Finding information on the team behind a startup is even more difficult in India and you have to research on the typical sources such as LinkedIn.',

Any startup that wants to go public lists on one of these exchanges. Bangalore (Karnataka) is the center of startup activity in India. The city has been the IT hub of India since the last two decades. Some other major cities where most startups have come up are Mumbai and Pune in Maharashtra, Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh, New Delhi, Chennai in Tamil Nadu and Kolkata in West Bengal.

Book publishing is smaller but significant in terms of revenue. Even though it's a mature industry, new magazines are being launched every year. India has been one of the fastest growing world economies since the past three years. Robust consumption and rising income levels have helped the growth of print media. New titles that focus on niche topics continue to launch in the market. The revenue sources for a magazine are subscription, single copy sales and advertisement. Approximately 73 percent of revenue comes from advertising and 27 percent from circulation.",
        paragraph4T: "The magazine industry is going through a tough phase in India just like in other countries. Newspapers have added supplements to their main issue and infringed on the content covered by magazines earlier. Television channels have launched in different genres that didn't exist a few years back. And with the increased penetration and adoption of the Internet in the country, more people are now consuming news and stories on different topics on the web and mobile. There is still a demand for high quality print content and magazines need to deliver on that need to avoid losing market share to other mediums. In addition, they also need to explore and distribute their content on the web and mobile platforms to give choice to their subscribers to consume content from anywhere and at any time.",
        paragraph4U: "India has 49,000 publications, but annual revenues total just $1.1 billion.

Regional language publications own 46 percent of the market share, Hindi language publications cover 44 percent and the remaining 10 percent is served by English publications. The primary penetration of English language magazines currently is in metros and urban centers though the growth is widening to smaller cities as the education and income levels increase among the middle class.",

Readership of newspapers and magazines is up 15% since 1998 to 180 million. It's a reflection of a younger, more educated population, especially in smaller cities.",
        paragraph4Z: "Now that the doors to foreign investors in print media have been thrown open, one can expect activity to pick up in this sector. Companies such as Pearson, Haymarket, Time India, News Corp., and Dow Jones have eyed India's big, English-reading market. ICICI Ventures, which holds stakes in three media companies, is quite bullish about the industry's prospects.",

Britain's Haymarket Publishing Group already has ties to Autocar India, with 80,000 subscribers. Haymarket doesn't own a stake, but helps with research and management. Now, it can invest, provide funds to print more copies, market more strongly and use Autocar as a platform to bring its other brands. Bombay's Tata Infomedia, a $30 million publisher of yellow pages and trade magazines, also has already started to solicit business with foreign companies. The Tata Group sold the Indian edition of Reader's Digest magazine, making it the first publishing property offered for sale since the government had scrapped the ban on foreign investment in the print media.",
        paragraph5B: "As expected, there have been various anti-FDI lobbies, which are strongly voicing protests against foreign investment in Indian Print Media. Their major contention is that foreign forces might begin dominating the content of Indian publications, which is detrimental to national interests. An extreme view given by a former Indian Prime Minister is that powered by their immense finances and goaded by an ambition to control the emerging Indian market, the foreign monopolies will impose their own agenda of ultimately controlling Indian politics. But there is more than meets the eye. The English-language media, fearing competition from players with deeper pockets, has been resisting this move by the Government. And from a marketing point of view, the English press reaches the most lucrative segment of society - the 300-million-strong middle class. International players are seen as a threat to market share.",
        paragraph5C: "The opening up of the print media sector to foreign investment is a bold decision by the Government, considering the unwillingness of so many past Governments to do the same. It is a policy decision that could have a very positive impact on the sector, provided the Indian publications generate enough interest and exhibit their true potential to the overseas investors.

High net-worth individuals are starting to form networks or groups that collectively evaluate and fund deals. There has been some momentum in the number of VC firms focusing on early stage investments. Bangalore-based Erasmic Venture Funds and Mumbai-based Seedfund typically invest less than $1 million. State government-backed venture capital funds are also seeing a revival in seed funding - several, including Karnataka, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh, have announced fresh funds. Large investment firms like Nexus India Capital, which has a $100 million India fund, and Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) that typically invest larger amounts, are showing interest in playing angel selectively. There is no shortage of startups or ideas but only a few entrepreneurs have the right experience, discipline and team required to execute well.",

It’s important to follow procedures to manage change requests since any diversions from the plan create breakdowns in product quality. We have adopted ISO and CMMI standards to help put structure in our processes and ensure that the entire team follows a common framework when building products and creating solutions. Our project management teams follow Agile processes to give us the flexibility to meet changing requirements while still managing quality.",

The true power of Arcgate will not come from how quickly we can keep growing, or how big we can become in two or five years but from our ideas and beliefs - respect for each other, team work, strong character and professionalism. We will succeed as a team or crumble.",

        paragraph8C: "Food and fitness industry is leveraging artificial intelligence and image recognition to help give its consumers recommendations for meals and exercise plans to help them achieve their long-terms health goals. Not only that, the concept of “track and trace” is changing the supply chain in food and beverages industry.

        paragraph8E: "Online handling of property listings and property management has become the new normal in the real estate industry. And thus everything from private equity firms to traditional brokerages are increasingly getting aware of the cost and time-saving benefits of technology in the real estate sector.

        paragraph8F: "Disruption within the retail industry is not entirely new. In early 90’s the ‘Big-Box’ stores like Walmart, Target began to replace mom and pop stores by becoming one-stop-shops for consumers and satisfying all their paper-shopping-list needs. Today, theses disruptors are being disrupted by ecommerce and online marketplaces. No longer do consumers need to make a stop at all! Online shopping has not only changed the shopping experience but also customer expectations; and it is the one that is having a far reaching impact around the globe. For established or emerging companies and startups; it is easy to take on a U.S. centric view when thinking about consumers, but making cross-continental connections is crucially important. What strategies may work in U.S may not work in Asia; thus it is important for companies to understand consumers in different markets to curate and personalize the online shopping experience.",
